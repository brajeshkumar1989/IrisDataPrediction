# [Iris- A small classic dataset from Fisher, 1936.](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/53/iris)

=========================

### Classification problem

---

Out of three classes two are linearly separable and one is separable non linearly.

### Dataset Information

---

Each instance is a plant

#### Additional information

---

This is one of the earliest datasets used in the literature on classification methods and widely used in statistics and machine learning. The data set contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a type of iris plant. One class is linearly separable from the other 2; the latter are not linearly separable from each other.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

#### Check Data Imbalance

#### Correlation checks
